1. Calculator Interface

Display Area

- The calculator provides a display area where the input expression and the calculated result are shown.
- It supports right-aligned text for clear visualization.

 Numeric Buttons

- Numeric buttons (0-9) allow users to input numbers for calculations.

 Basic Operators

- The calculator includes basic arithmetic operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

 Trigonometric Functions

- Trigonometric functions include sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) for angle calculations.
- Trigonometric functions operate in degrees or radians, depending on the calculator's mode.

 Exponentiation Functions

- The calculator supports functions for raising a number to a power, including x^2 (squared) and x^3 (cubed).

 Square Root and Cube Root

- Square root (√) and cube root (³√) functions allow users to calculate roots of numbers.

 Clear and Delete Functions

- The "C" button clears the input and result area, resetting the calculator.
- The "<" button deletes the last character in the input area.

 Equals and Result Display

- The "=" button calculates the result of the entered expression and displays it in the result area.

 2. Functionality

 Arithmetic Operations

- The calculator performs standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

 Trigonometric Calculations

- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) provide solutions for angles in degrees or radians.

 Exponentiation

- Exponentiation functions (x^2, x^3) calculate the square and cube of a number, respectively.

 Square Root and Cube Root

- Square root (√) and cube root (³√) functions compute the corresponding roots of a number.

 Clear and Delete

- Clearing (C) resets the calculator to its initial state, clearing all input and results.
- Deleting (<) removes the last character in the input area, allowing users to correct mistakes.

 Evaluation and Result Display

- The "=" button evaluates the entered expression and displays the result in the result area.
- The calculator handles complex expressions and provides error messages for invalid input.

 3. Usage Instructions

Entering Expressions

- Users can input expressions by clicking numeric buttons and operators.
- Parentheses can be used for grouping in complex expressions.

 Evaluating Expressions

- To calculate the result, press the "=" button.
- The calculator follows the order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS) for evaluation.

Clearing and Deleting

- Use the "C" button to clear the input and result area.
- The "<" button deletes the last character in the input area.

 Trigonometric Functions

- Select the trigonometric function (sin, cos, tan), enter the angle value, and press "=" to get the result.

 Exponentiation and Root Functions

- Use x^2 and x^3 to calculate squared and cubed values.
- √ calculates the square root, and ³√ calculates the cube root.
